    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery</li>
        <li>celery tops</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>3 containers chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, combine chicken, celery and their tops, carrot, onion and its peel, and pepper. Pour broth over and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender and falls from the bone, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>While chicken is cooking, make noodles. In a large bowl, combine eggs, water, oil, salt and enough of the flour to make a stiff dough.</li>
